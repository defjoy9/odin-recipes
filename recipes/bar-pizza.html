    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>if you’ve not had the best luck making pizza at home, this is the style for you. While it does take a while to rise, the dough is dead simple and very easy to work with. There’s no rolling or spinning here: We simply press it flat…very flat…top it, then pop it in the oven.  </p>
    <p>Whether you’re a pizza making novice or a jaded professional, this is a great pizza. I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Pizza Dough:</h4>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons dry active yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water, at about 105 degrees F (41 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3 2/3 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons corn oil or other vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce:</h4>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 1/2 cups San Marzano tomato puree (from 1 can San Marzano tomatoes), or plain tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pizzas:</h4>
    <ul class="ingredients"> 
        <li>1/2 cup corn oil, divided, to grease pizza pans</li>
        <li>8 ounces grated sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Stir yeast, sugar, and water together in a bowl; let sit for about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in flour and mix until a dry, shaggy dough forms. Add salt, butter, and 2 tablespoons oil and mix to combine.  </li>
        <li>Knead with your hands in the bowl until dough comes together, then turn out onto the counter and continue to knead until a stiff but smooth dough forms, about 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Return dough to the bowl; rub the surface of the dough with a small amount of oil. Cover the bowl and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, up to 6 hours. Alternately, place dough in the refrigerator to rise overnight. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the pizza sauce. Blend San Marzano tomatoes until smooth using a stick blender or in the jar of an electric blender. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of the tomato puree and place into a bowl. Stir in 1 teaspoon kosher salt, dried oregano, and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate until ready to make the pizzas. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Drizzle 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons oil into a 10- to 12-inch pizza pan. </li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 pieces and roll into balls. Keep dough covered when not using. Press 1 dough ball into a round disc and place on the prepared pizza pan. Press and stretch dough flat, almost all the way to the edge of the pan. Poke the dough all over with a fork. </li>
        <li>Once the dough is properly punctured, top with about 1/3 cup sauce, spreading all the way to the edge of dough. Top the entire surface with 2 ounces each of Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and bottom of pizza is browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas. </li>
    </ol>
